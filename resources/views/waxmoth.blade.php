<h3>Back to the hive!</h3>
<h1>Wax Moths/Wax Worms</h1>
<p>Believe it or not, a moth can be a devastating pest to any beehive. Just 1 singular wax
    moth can slip in the hive in the night, lay eggs and leave. And they
    wont stop at just one hive, they can fly up to 50 meters.
    So other hives in the area can also be infested by a single wax
    moth. This larvae can chew through
    comb and destroy entire brood frames. This in turn can cause the hive to abandon the nest
    and leave. Luckily preventing the wax moth isn't as difficult as other pests.
</p>
<h2>Ways to stop and prevent</h2>
<p>A strong hive will easily take care of wax moth larvae, even if the moth is able to breach
    the hive and lay eggs they will immediately be taken out and discarded. If you suspect that
    a frame has wax moth eggs then take the frame and put it in your freezer for 2 days. This will
    kill eggs in the frame.
