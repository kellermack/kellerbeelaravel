<h3>Back to the Hive!!</h3>
<h1>Varroa Destructor <span>These things suck(literally)</span></h1>
<p>
    The Varroa Destructor, or Varroa Mite is single handly the reason for most
    bee hive failures. A small mite(or tick) that feeds on honeybees and honeybee
    larvae. Left unchecked they will decimate even the strongest of hives. Every year
    nearly all beekeepers must treat the hives for varroa. Some do a spring and then fall
    treatment, I myself have been able to do only a once a year treatment and so far that
    has worked. I alternate every year with my treatments between Mite Away Quick Strips
    and Apivar. It has been noted that the varroa  can become resistent to some
    treatments if they are used contiounssly.

<h2>How bad is my varroa count?</h2>
<p>Their are a few methods to determine how bad the mite count is in your hive.
<ul>
    <li>The Alcohol Wash
        <p>This method can be the most accurate and effective method. The downside of
            this method is that this will kill the bees sampled. You will need
            about 300 bees, which is around 1/2 a cup, bees are dumped in a jar with
            Isopropyl alcohol. It is then shaken and swirled (with the lid on) for
            around 2 minutes. The bees are then dumped on a wire mesh so that the mites
            fall through. The mites are then counted and divided by 3 to determine how many
            mites your hive has per 100 bees. MAKE 100% SURE YOU DO NOT HAVE THE QUEEN IN THE
            SAMPLE!!!!!!
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>The Sugar Shake Shake Senora
        <p>
            I have used this method a few times, it's not as affective for the count
            but the upside is it doesnt kill the bees. Similar set up as the alcohol
            wash, 1/2 cup of bees, jar (with a lid with small holes) to dump them in and instead of alcohol you use
            powdered sugar. Shake the bees toward the jar lid so the mites will fall out of
            the jar but the bees stay in. Do this for a minute or so, then dump the bees back
            in the hive, dont worry about the sugar as the other bees will help them clean it off.
            Go back to where you shook out the sugar and look for tiny dark specks, those are the mites.
            Count and then divide by 100. If you have more then 3-5 while counting it is time
            to treat.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Treatments</h2>
<p>A variety of chemical treatments exist to control Varroa. These are just
    to name a few.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Apivar</li>
    <li>Mite Away Quick Strips</li>
    <li>Oxalic Acid</li>
</ol>
<p>Many other treatments exist but regardless of which treatment you choose remember to
    read the instructions carefully, wear gloves, remove all honey supers and also to alternate
    treatments.
    <br>
    Another idea to keep in mind is the use of screened bottom boards. When mites fall down
    they have no way of getting back up to the bees, they fall through the holes in the board.
    The use of screened versus solid bottom boards will be brought up in another disucssion.
