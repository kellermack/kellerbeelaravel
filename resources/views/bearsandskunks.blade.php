<h3>Back to the Hive!!</h3>
<h1>Bears and....Skunks?!</h1>

<h2>Bears</h2>
<p>It is no secret that bears are attracted to beehives. But many believe its the smell of honey
    that attracts bears however in truth bears are really after the bees and larvae inside the hive.
    The bees, larvae and eggs inside of a hive are a high protein source for hungry bears. Now that
    being said bears do enjoy honey just not as much as Yogi made it out to be.
</p>
<h2>How to stop bears</h2>
<p>There is only one option to stopping bears from destroying your beehives and that
    is with an electric fence. The higher the voltage the better, any other type of fence
    and a bear is just going to walk right through it. Also make sure your fence area is properly
    maintained. Don't allow grass and weeds to take over the fence, this will drain
    the battery of the fence. Have a clear area and a solid electric fence and the bears
    shouldn't be a concern.
</p>

<h2>Skunks?</h2>
<p>You might be asking yourself, "Why would a skunk bother a bee hive?" Well Skunks
    love to eat bees. A skunk will walk to the entrance of a bee hive and coerce the bees
    to come out, usually by bothering the entrance to the hive. When the bees come out the skunk
    grabs them out of the air and eats them. The only area that is vulnerable to bee stings on
    a skunk is the stomach, and if your bee hive isn't high enough off the ground the skunk doesnt
    have to stand and the bees can never reach that area.

<h2>How to stop a skunk</h2>
<p>Skunks can be halted by fences, just like bears an electric one would work better but it
    has been observed that skunks can burrow underneath the fences to get to the hive. So
    what can also be done is to raise the hive itself to about 3 feet from the ground to the entrance.
    This would make it more difficult for the skunk to bother the hive, some beekeepers also
    will use carpet strips with tacks to deter the skunk. If they are put on the front of the hive
    with tacks facing out the skunk will be poked and possibly give up the attempt at hurting the hive.
